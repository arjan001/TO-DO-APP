1. How long did you spend on the coding test? What would you add to your
solution if you had more time? If you didn't spend much time on the coding
test then use this as an opportunity to explain what you would add.

At most i did spend an 1 hour and a half on some feature while other took me about 2 to 3 hours to be done interms of the landing page that took me absolutely about 27 minutes to come up with the  TO DO APP user interface  and another half an hour to make the page more mobile friendly with more time i would have make the TODO APP store separate user tasks with login and registration system by implementing a php autheentication system and a MYSQL  database to store different users tasks

2. Which parts did you spend the most time with? What did you find most
difficult?

on the parts that i did find more difficult these include adding the dragging features  positioning the  toggle buttons for light and dark mode  and creating the filter functionality for the app   while i did spend much time on  was adding a click listener on the check box  also  creating the task dragging functionality 

3. What was the most useful feature that was added to the latest version of
Vue.js? Please include a snippet of code that shows how you've used it

Though i wasnt able to include vue js on the design process  but i can say the resent new feature available on vue js is   since i used vanilla JavaScript an incedible faeture that i used is 

4. How would you track down a performance issue in production? Have you
ever had to do this?

before setting up for production first tracking can be through your git project repository to see all changes whats been staged and what not also what need fixing and whats left to be done  also before pushing it for production i would conduct various unit test to see any parts that need attention and fixing  before pushing into production ,i've never  done this before 


5. How did you find the test overall? Did you have any issues or have
difficulties completing? If you have any suggestions on how we can improve
the test, we'd love to hear them.

The test was amaizing the only thing that was limiting was being confined to the design of the project and having no choice to use another language on the test only the once instructed  but as for me am not aware of that vue js soo i did use vanilla javascript on the todo app
